Title: Pasung — The Hidden Face of Mental Health in Indonesia

For decades, many Indonesians suffering from severe mental illnesses have faced a practice known locally as “pasung”. The word “pasung” refers to the physical restraint or confinement of people with mental disorders—often by their own families—using wooden stocks, chains, or small locked rooms. It is a desperate measure born from a mix of poverty, social stigma, and the lack of accessible mental health care.

Although the Indonesian government officially banned pasung in 1977, the practice persists, especially in rural areas where psychiatric services are scarce. According to periodic reports from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, thousands of people remain in some form of confinement each year. Families who resort to pasung often believe they are protecting their loved ones from harming themselves or others, not realizing the long-term trauma and human rights violations involved.

In recent years, Indonesia’s “Bebas Pasung” (Free from Pasung) campaign has made progress. Local governments, NGOs, and community health workers collaborate to identify and release individuals from confinement. Once freed, patients are connected to mental health services through the Puskesmas (community health clinics) and referred to hospitals when needed. Some regions, such as Aceh and West Java, have reported a sharp reduction in pasung cases thanks to mobile mental health outreach teams.

Despite these advances, challenges remain. Mental health facilities are unevenly distributed across the archipelago, and stigma continues to prevent families from seeking professional help. Many Indonesians still associate mental illness with spiritual disturbance or moral weakness, turning instead to traditional healers. Experts say that without sustained funding, education, and mental health integration at the primary care level, pasung will not disappear completely.

Ending pasung is not only about freeing people from chains—it is about restoring dignity. It represents the broader struggle to make mental health a public priority in Indonesia, transforming compassion from a private burden into a collective responsibility.
